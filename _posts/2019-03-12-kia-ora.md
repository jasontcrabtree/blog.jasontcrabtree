I solve problems for people and businesses. I do that thoughtfully,
creatively and pragmatically. Recently I've spent my days working in
Customer Experience Design focused on cross-channel service design. At
night, I’m learning to digital product design.

After five years working for New Zealand’s largest insurance company,
I’ve changed industries and continents. On January 29, 2019 I packed
my life into a suitcase and moved to Dublin, Ireland.

I'm now on the hunt for new opportunities. My focus is working with a
business-business software (SaaS) company solving meaningful problems
for people and businesses. I believe helping people at work is a huge
leverage point for helping to improve people's lives.

I’m a team player, empathetic and good under pressure. I get stuff
done and I’m a quick learner with knowledge in lots of different
areas. I’d love to learn more about how we can work together — and how
I can help you and your business.
