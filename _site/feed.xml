&lt;!-- ![Kia Ora, Please Come in. Welcome to my first ever blog post!](/assets/Beers-and-Bike2.png#heroImage) --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited to welcome you to the first blog post published on my own domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please come in, enjoy your stay — have a look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really participated in the hey-day dominance of blogging. I don’t think my few posts on Medium quite count. So this will be a whole new experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a personal blog created in March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future blog posts topics will include design, technology and long-form-thoughts on things I find interesting in humanties and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: All future posts WILL be full of em dashes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to come along for the ride, I’d love it if you subscribed to my RSS feed or followed me on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for visiting!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason</name></author><summary type="html">Welcome to the blogzone 👉 come on in...</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/Beers-and-Bike2.png/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Adventures In Dublin</title><link href="/Mar/2019/adventures-in-dublin.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Adventures In Dublin" /><published>2019-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/Mar/2019/adventures-in-dublin</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Mar/2019/adventures-in-dublin.html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-do-list&quot;&gt;To-do-list:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ted</name></author><summary type="html">An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bananas</title><link href="/Mar/2019/bananas.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bananas" /><published>2019-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/Mar/2019/bananas</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Mar/2019/bananas.html">&lt;p&gt;A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds
of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called “plantains”,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ted</name></author><summary type="html">A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kia Ora, I&amp;#8217;m Jason Crabtree</title><link href="/Mar/2019/kia-ora,-i'm-jason-crabtree.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kia Ora, I'm Jason Crabtree" /><published>2019-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/Mar/2019/kia-ora,-i'm-jason-crabtree</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Mar/2019/kia-ora,-i'm-jason-crabtree.html">&lt;p&gt;I solve problems for people and businesses. I do that thoughtfully,
creatively and pragmatically. Recently I’ve spent my days working in
Customer Experience Design focused on cross-channel service design. At
night, I’m learning to digital product design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After five years working for New Zealand’s largest insurance company,
I’ve changed industries and continents. On January 29, 2019 I packed
my life into a suitcase and moved to Dublin, Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now on the hunt for new opportunities. My focus is working with a
business-business software (SaaS) company solving meaningful problems
for people and businesses. I believe helping people at work is a huge
leverage point for helping to improve people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a team player, empathetic and good under pressure. I get stuff
done and I’m a quick learner with knowledge in lots of different
areas. I’d love to learn more about how we can work together — and how
I can help you and your business.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason</name></author><summary type="html">I solve problems for people and businesses.
