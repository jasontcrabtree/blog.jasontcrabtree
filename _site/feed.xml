&lt;p&gt;Video found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.slackhq.com/home/default.aspx&quot;&gt;Slack‚Äôs Investor Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform that everything sits on, connecting different data sources, tools, jobs and functions? That definitely sounds like an operating system to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm writing this down today so I can look back in a few years to see if my hunch has paid off ‚Äî that Slack launches a new core product based on doing non-messaging work inside Slack, with messaging as a core, enabling product extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of the investment and work they‚Äôve put into integrating different systems to Slack, it seems like a natural extension for them that one day you‚Äôll load Slack and go to the ‚ÄòHomepage‚Äô and do work from within the client, rather than ever loading the underlying apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can do a multiplication calculation in a browser bar or using Mac‚Äôs Spotlight, why would I ever use a calculator? I think a similar concept could apply to Slack and the multitude of SaaS products integrated with it one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, that seems like a pretty effective strategic flywheel for them to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrate all of your collaboration, communication, productivity and workload within one core operating system? That concept sounds compelling ‚Äî and like something that just gets better and better the more you invest in it, both for users, workplaces, Slack and integrated SaaS products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a total coincidence that my first two blog posts are about Slack ‚Äî future posts will be on a range of subjects (I‚Äôve got a long list of post ideas about digital product design, coding, tech, careers, and a few other hard to label topics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can access that here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.html&quot;&gt;Slack‚Äôs S-1 Document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few interesting points in this S-1, particularly their decision do a direct listing, meaning they will list on the NYSE without an underwriter negotiating the sale of their shares. As far as I can tell, Slack is using the public listing as a way to create overall liquidity for their shares and shareholders and show their commitment to build a long-term business. That‚Äôs opposed to more typical IPO‚Äôs, which are often used primarily as a way to raise capital for growth (they have more than enough of that in the bank).
The document itself is fascinating ‚Äî if you‚Äôre that way inclined I‚Äôd definitely recommend checking it out. My favourite part ‚Äî and the part I want to talk about now is the section titled: ‚Äò&lt;strong&gt;What Sets Us Apart&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äô on page 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few quotes really stand out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the heading &lt;strong&gt;Customer-centricity is the fundamental tenet of our company&lt;/strong&gt; Slack explains &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWe built our software and user interface around the real needs of human beings.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; This shows a strong belief in the idea of building a business that focuses on its customers and people first and trusting that the financial results will take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a strategic perspective, the &lt;strong&gt;Growth Strategy&lt;/strong&gt; heading is a goldmine. I think it‚Äôs worth emphasising both the bullet points they‚Äôve used and the order they‚Äôre listed as showing deep insight into Slack‚Äôs strategic priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Interpreting the growth pillars they discuss, this is how Slack view their growth plan:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve the Slack product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on sales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on customer engagement and operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work on cross-organisation Slack usage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build more enterprise features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further international expansion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build out their developer ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Future tech advances (Workflow Automation, AI, Machine Learning and Search)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bullet points highlight a focus on product development first, then product distribution, and then lastly advanced tech capabilities. I think this focus on product distribution and incremental improvements instead of relying on world-changing technological advances happening in the near-term is an interesting distinction to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, no discussion on a document like this is complete without acknowledging some of the flaws, pitfalls and things to work on. Slack is not profitable ‚Äî and its expenses have increased relative to its (rapidly growing revenue). It also lists no fewer than Microsoft, Google and Facebook as potential future competitors. It seems Slack has a long path ahead of it, but I‚Äôm definitely interested to see how that plays out with its people and customer first strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason</name></author><summary type="html">A brief review of Slack's Strategic Plans, as told by their recent S-1 document</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello World</title><link href="/2019/hello-world.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello World" /><published>2019-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2019/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/hello-world.html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so excited to welcome you to the first blog post published on my own domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please come in, enjoy your stay ‚Äî have a look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really participated in the hey-day dominance of blogging. I don‚Äôt think my few posts on Medium quite count. So this will be a whole new experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a personal blog created in March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future blog posts topics will include design, technology and long-form-thoughts on things I find interesting in humanties and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Future posts WILL be full of em dashes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôd like to come along for the ride, I‚Äôd love it if you subscribed to my RSS feed or followed me on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
