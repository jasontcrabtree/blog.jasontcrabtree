&lt;p&gt;You can access that here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.html&quot;&gt;Slack’s S-1 Document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a few interesting parts of this S-1, particularly their decision do a direct listing, meaning they will list on the NYSE without an underwriting negotiating their sales. As far as I can tell, Slack is using the public listing as a way to create liquidity for their shares and shareholders, and show their commitment to build a long-term business. That is opposed to normal IPO’s, which are typically used as as a way to raise more money for growth (they have more than enough of that in the bank).
The document itself is really interesting, if you’re that way inclinced I’d definitely recommend checking it out. My favourite part — and the part I want to talk about now, is the section titled: ‘&lt;strong&gt;What Sets Us Apart&lt;/strong&gt;’ on page 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few quotes that really stand out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the heading &lt;strong&gt;Customer-centricity is the fundamental tenet of our company&lt;/strong&gt; Slack explains &lt;em&gt;“We built our software and user interface around the real needs of human beings.”&lt;/em&gt; This is a strong belief in the idea of building a business that focuses on its customers and people first, and trusting that the financial results will take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a strategic perspective, the &lt;strong&gt;Growth Strategy&lt;/strong&gt; heading is a goldmine. I think bullet points they’ve used, and their order, provide a deep insight into Slack’s priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Interpreting the growth pillars they discuss, this is how Slack view their growth plan:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve the Slack product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on sales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on customer engagement and operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work on cross-organisation Slack usage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build more enterprise features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further international expansion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build out their developer ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Future tech advances (Workflow Automation, AI, Machine Learning and Search)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bullet points highlight a focus on product development first, then product distribution, and lastly advanced tech capabilities. I think this focus on distribution and incremental improvements instead of relying on world-changing technological advances happening in the near-term is an interesting distinction to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, no discussion on a document like this is complete without acknowledging some of the flaws, pitfalls and things to work on. Slack is not profitable — and its expenses have increased relative to its (rapidly growing revenue). It also lists no fewer than Microsoft, Google and Facebook as potential future competitors. It seems Slack has a long path ahead of it, but I’m definitely interested to see how that plays out with its people and customer first strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jason</name></author><summary type="html">A brief review of Slack's Strategic Plans, as told by their recent S-1 document</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello Blog</title><link href="/Mar/2019/hello-blog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello Blog" /><published>2019-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/Mar/2019/hello-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Mar/2019/hello-blog.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m so excited to welcome you to the first blog post published on my own domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please come in, enjoy your stay — have a look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really participated in the hey-day dominance of blogging. I don’t think my few posts on Medium quite count. So this will be a whole new experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a personal blog created in March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future blog posts topics will include design, technology and long-form-thoughts on things I find interesting in humanties and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Future posts WILL be full of em dashes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to come along for the ride, I’d love it if you subscribed to my RSS feed or followed me on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
